    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a small baking dish, and spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned. Remove from pan, and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool.</li>
        <li>Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter, and season with salt and pepper. Spread pate over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in the center. Fold up, and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of the dough, and brush with egg yolk.</li>
        <li>Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown. Set aside, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef stock and red wine; boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, and serve with beef.</li>
    </ol>
